- Fix to range pkbots able to generate with p2p items on f2p world on old builds

V3.1 Patch notes:
- Farming fixes to bugged patches (Pls note if u have bugged patches u will need to clear all ur patches, since for example allotment patches are linked together, so if 1 of them is bugged it can also mess up the others)
^As I did quite a bit of cleanup to farming code on 3.0 to make it more readable it was much easier now to see whats happening and why.
^I did quite a bit of testing on allotments, herbs, flowers and hops and couldnt anymore cause a bugged patch, other patches received the same fixes too, but they work bit differently so those might still have some issues.

- Rewrote combat formulas & changed npc stats (for pretty much every npc) to match osrs wiki. Feel free to report issues, but atleast based on my small testing seems to be working. (Previously npcs didnt have that much to do with their real rs counterparts)
If any1 is wondering why they were so incorrect before its because the amount of data & info how everything works was very different ~10 years ago when I started the project compared to whats available now, so back then just had to come up with something that does the job.

^NOTE: if u reset quest its best to also get rid of any quest items u have for that quest (you will have to do that manually)

V1.9 Patch notes:
- Support for pre #274 caches, currently have: #254. (if cache between #254-#274 is found, it might need little tweaking before it works, as currently can't know accurately in which build they made the changes in)

V1.8.3 Patch notes:
- Botting fixes on lower builds

V1.8.2 Patch notes:

- New command ::ms (changes ur movement system)

V1.8.1 Patch notes:
- Minor fixes

- New config: BOT_LOGIN (mainly useful if u have lower end cpu, which usually leads to bunch of bots stuck at lumby castle)

- Updated drop system (+drops thx to: Oyusveyus)
- ROW logic changed to work like in the real game
- updated config: ITEM_DROP_RATES (as the old one wouldnt work with the new system)
- Spinolyps can now be attacked with melee
- ::bot cheat (BETA) basically makes the account bot like a progressive bot would, to stop botting you need to logout, to continue from last time just use the command again (Note: if u logout while the bot is not active, no botting data is getting saved, so it will reset u to lumb the next time u use it)
^Also note the bot cheat will use the quest cheat too.

V1.7.4 Patch notes:
- Crashing fix for older builds (Earlier #289 crashed easily during combat)
- Some anim fixes for older builds
- Found 1 new gamebuild that seem to work: #372
- Some patches to make modded caches work with less issues
- Modded* caches: 274, 308, 317, 327, 332, 337, 368 (these are included in a separate folder and you will need to copy these into clients & servers cache folder if you want to use these)
* = These caches were missing some files that made them not work with this, now these have been "fixed" by taking some files from some other cache that works. Each of the these caches now also have a log that shows: what was originally missing, what got added and from which cache, and whats missing from the modded cache. Each of these caches are still like 97+% authentic, so shouldnt probably be too noticeable.

- Patched KBD on #289
- Patched Mage Arena objects on lower builds
- Patched Npcs aggroing through walls
- Added Brother Jered
- Fixed anim related crash
- Adjusted anims for 2h's and spears on lower builds (likely wrong anims, but I guess better than no anims at all)
- Bots (NOTE: lots of door, gate, ladder etc. ids might have changed on lower builds, so bots might get stuck easier on lower builds, I did patch quite a bit of these but possibly not all)
- Rewritten bot login system
- New bot configs:
BOT_ESCAPE_HIGH_LVLS (not tested)
FORCE_RESET_BOTS

V1.4 Patch notes:
- Hans can be configured to sell membership (didnt test, should work)

- ::lvls command that adds right click menu to skills to set the lvls

- Filtering clues & rewards
- Movement related fix (Credits: Gallus)
- Bots should be mostly prepared for lower builds (still disabled though)
- New skillguide system (As a player you shouldnt really see a difference except for example the empty tabs for barrows and white items will be gone on lower builds, the way they were originally done wasnt really practical for a server like this where they need adjusting depending on whats available. Was a huge amount of work to recreate all the menus using the new system)
- New cheat "char"
